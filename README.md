# K-Means and Spectral Clustering on 2D Dataset

### Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering and Spectral Clustering algorithms to a two-dimensional dataset stored in a CSV file. The spectral clustering method is experimented with different values of epsilon. The obtained clusters from both methods are visualized for analysis.
